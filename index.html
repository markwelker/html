	<h2>About Me</h2>
	<p>I'm a Junior in the CS department here at Brigham Young University. I've
	taken several classes in Computer Science, but definitely don't consider
	myself an expert yet.</p>

	<p>I was born in American Fork, Utah, but have lived most of my life in
	various places around the country. Most recently I call Maryland home.</p>
